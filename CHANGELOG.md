# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 0.12.1

### Fixed

- `check --tighten-baseline` rewrote entries in matching order, so a
  run that changed nothing still reordered `.crap-baseline.json` (noisy
  diffs). It now keeps the `--save-baseline` order; a no-op tighten
  leaves the file byte-identical.

## 0.12.0

### Added

- `check --tighten-baseline`: ratchets `.crap-baseline.json` down from a
  full run — ceilings drop to current measures, fixed entries are
  removed, new violations are never added (unlike re-running
  `--save-baseline`), grown violations keep their old ceiling, and
  entries of gates that did not run are untouched. Then checks like
  `--baseline`. Refuses partial selections.

## 0.11.0

### Changed

- `analyze`: a source file missing from the LCOV report (no test loaded
  it) is now scored as 0% covered instead of N/A when it lives under a
  top-level directory the report covers (e.g. `lib/`). Previously a
  brand-new, completely untested file had CRAP N/A and never exceeded
  the threshold — the worst code was invisible. Files under directories
  the report does not cover (e.g. `test/`) stay N/A. Opt out with
  `coverage.unloaded_as_uncovered: false`.

## 0.10.2

### Fixed

- `--diff` / `--diff-base` found nothing when the project is a
  subdirectory of its git repository (monorepo package): `git diff`
  printed repository-root paths (`app/lib/...`) that never matched the
  project-relative sources. It now runs `git diff --relative`.

## 0.10.1

### Fixed

- `check --baseline` ignored `severity: warning` gates: their results
  count as passed, and the baseline only filtered failed gates, so every
  baselined violation was still reported as a warning.

## 0.10.0

Fork release (ferrarafer/crap4dart). Minor bump: `.crap-baseline.json`
is now version 2 (version 1 files still load).

### Added

- `duplication` gate: new `sources` key — additional file/directory paths
  (resolved against the project root) unioned into the duplication scan,
  enabling cross-module duplicate detection in monorepos without widening
  the CRAP analysis scope.
- `crap.count_constructors` (default `false`): score constructors that
  have a body as methods, named `<Class>.<name>` (`<Class>.new` for the
  unnamed constructor). Constructors were unconditionally skipped, which
  hides factory constructors doing validation, JSON normalization or
  mapping work — a common shape in freezed/Flutter model layers, where
  the branching lives in the factory rather than in a method. Bodyless
  and redirecting constructors (`factory Foo() = _Foo;`) stay skipped.
  Off by default: enabling it adds rows to the report and can raise the
  max CRAP of an existing project.

### Fixed

- Baseline: violations were keyed by line number, so any edit above a
  baselined violation (even one blank line) turned it into a "new"
  violation, and measured messages (`1856 lines`, `8.98% duplicated`,
  `coverage 53.0%`) stopped matching as soon as the number moved — even
  when it improved. Baselines now match on gate + file + message shape
  (numbers masked) with per-key counts, and measured violations carry a
  `measure` ceiling: they stay covered while they shrink and fail once
  they grow. `.crap-baseline.json` is now version 2 (no `line`, optional
  `measure`); version 1 files still load.
- `GateRunner` registered `broken_goldens`, `test_assertions`,
  `folder_structure` and `external` twice, so they ran (and reported)
  twice — 25 gate results for 21 gates.
- `analyze --lcov <file>` no longer re-runs the test suite first.
  Because `coverage.run_tests` defaults to `true`, an explicit coverage
  file was silently replaced by a fresh (possibly very long) test run.
  An explicit `--lcov` now skips the config-driven run; `--run-tests`
  still forces one.
- `init` template and README showed `coverage.run_tests: false`,
  contradicting the actual default (`true` since 0.9.0).
- Cyclomatic complexity: `switch` **expression** arms were not counted.
  Only `SwitchCase`/`SwitchPatternCase`/`SwitchDefault` (statement form)
  incremented complexity, so a Dart 3 `switch` expression scored CC 1
  no matter how many arms it had, while the equivalent `switch`
  statement scored one per arm. A 9-arm expression at 0% coverage
  reported CRAP 2.00 instead of 110.00 — an under-report of the exact
  anti-pattern the tool exists to find, on code that is idiomatic modern
  Dart. `SwitchExpressionCase` now counts, so both forms score the same.

### Changed

- `GateRunner`: the three parallel 21-arm `switch` expressions mapping a
  gate id to its `enabled`/`ignorable`/`severity` flag are now lookup
  tables. With the complexity fix above they were CC 23 each (over the
  project's own limit of 12) and drove `GateRunner`'s WMC to 109.

## 0.9.5

### Fixed

- `profile`: per-method counters inflated quadratically on hot paths.
  The collector re-merged its CUMULATIVE in-memory counters into the
  output file on every flush (every 5 calls) instead of only the delta
  since the last flush, so a method with millions of real calls reported
  tens of billions of calls and impossible TOTALs (48.5G calls / 3538h
  in a 10-second run on flutter_agent; real CPU was ~4h). MEAN and %
  looked correct only because numerator and denominator carried the same
  inflation factor. Flushes now merge deltas and advance snapshots only
  after a successful write; `CrapCollector.flush()` can be called to
  persist the tail without waiting for the next 5th call.

### Added

- `profile`: `SELF` column and `totalSelfMicros` in JSON output —
  self time excluding nested instrumented calls (flamegraph semantics),
  so hot code is ranked by actual CPU burn rather than by how many
  callers fan out through it. The collector now receives method
  entry/exit events (`enter`/`exit`) instead of a bare exit record and
  keeps a call stack of Stopwatches; `TOTAL` remains inclusive time.

### Fixed (earlier in 0.9.5)

- `profile`: the `TOTAL` column no longer overflows into a wall of
  digits at extreme call counts. At tens of billions of calls (a hot
  inner loop, e.g. markdown parsing) `toStringAsFixed(2)` rendered
  values like `50000000.00`, blowing the column width up. Total time is
  now rendered with adaptive units — `82.50ms`, `13.89s`, `22.50m`,
  `13.89h` — in both the column and the summary line (ranks and means
  were already correct). Found profiling a markdown pipeline; reported
  upstream and fixed here.

## 0.9.4

### Fixed

- `test_assertions`: trailing named arguments (`skip:`, `timeout:`) no
  longer hide the test body. The gate now uses the second positional
  argument as the body instead of `args.last`, so assertions inside
  `test('...', () { ... }, skip: true)` and `testWidgets(..., skip:)`
  are counted correctly.

## 0.9.3

### Fixed

- `profile`: explicit test paths no longer run the WHOLE suite — the
  default `test` directory selector was passed unconditionally before
  the requested paths, and `dart test`/`flutter test` treat every
  positional argument as a selector, so `crap4dart profile
  path/to/a_test.dart` profiled all 450+ files while appearing to
  profile one. The `test` dir is now passed only when no explicit
  paths are given. Found profiling yoloit: a single-file run kept
  collecting timings for the entire repository.

## 0.9.2

### Fixed

- `profile`: isolate-safe collector flush — temp files now carry the
  isolate identity hash (microsecond names collided across parallel
  test isolates, making flushes rename each other), and the merge read
  retries once around a concurrent rename instead of discarding the
  accumulated data as corrupt. Fixes the "instrumented runner drops a
  shard after ~30 tests" report from a full-suite yoloit run —
  verified end-to-end: 4523 methods, complete report, no shard loss.
- `profile`: MEAN column marks sub-30µs means with `~` (instrumentation
  overhead dominates there; a method that got FASTER can show a higher
  mean after its neighbors were optimized — read CALLS/TOTAL deltas).

## 0.9.1

### Fixed

- `broken_goldens` tofu detection precision: an anchored convergence
  baseline (letter glyph arcs like "m" previously faked the X), solid
  top-border and clear-above checks, continuous side walls and
  sustained diagonal movement. Verified on three real projects: all
  large broken icons caught, zero glyph/TUI false positives.

## 0.9.0

### Added

- `broken_goldens`: tofu icon detection — broken icon placeholders
  (the box-with-an-X of a failed image load) are flagged in golden
  PNGs by their shape: bordered square, converging diagonal bands,
  crossing in the middle. Verified on real goldens: 5/5 broken caught
  (one missed by the human reviewer), zero false positives on terminal
  UI screenshots and outlined digit glyphs.
- `crap4dart goldens` command: `--print-snippet` / `--write` emits the
  `guardGoldens` test helper that turns image-load errors into failing
  assertions inside golden tests (standard Image.asset/network paths).

### Changed

- BREAKING: `coverage.run_tests` now defaults to `true` — `analyze`
  runs the test suite to produce coverage instead of reporting all-N/A
  CRAP scores. Opt out with `run_tests: false` (bare `crap4dart`
  first-run experience drove this: a wall of N/A helped no one).

## 0.8.7

### Fixed

- `analyze`: N/A entries (no coverage data) are now ordered by file
  path and line — Dart's unstable sort previously shuffled them when
  every score was N/A.
- `analyze`: the "no LCOV coverage data found" warning now includes a
  hint on how to generate coverage (`flutter test --coverage` or
  `coverage.run_tests: true`).

## 0.8.6

### Changed

- Performance: `broken_goldens` pixel scanning rewritten as a single
  classification pass (`_PixelStats`) with an early exit when no
  stripe-yellow pixels exist — instrumented profiling showed the gate
  at 96% of total CPU time (1.68 billion per-pixel calls); the full
  check run is now ~80x faster on golden-heavy suites.
- Performance: compiled globs are cached per pattern in
  `GateContext.matchesAnyGlob` (was re-parsed for every file x
  pattern across all gates).
- `unused_code`: removed a double AST traversal for class members.

### Fixed

- `unused_code`: references made from mixin/extension/enum method
  bodies are counted again (a class-level-only reference pass missed
  them, false-positive "never referenced" on top-level helpers called
  from mixins).

## 0.8.5

### Fixed

- `broken_goldens`: overflow-stripe detection now requires real
  yellow/black alternation (>= 4 transitions, yellow >= 1/3 of the
  run) instead of "yellow and black pixels in a line" — dark terminal
  UIs with sparse yellow text (TUI screenshots) no longer
  false-positive.
- Internal: workspace profile pubspec rewriting extracted into
  `WorkspacePubspec` (ProfileRunner back under the WMC limit); stripe
  detector row/column scans deduplicated.

## 0.8.4

### Fixed

- `magic_constants`: all literals inside `const` declarations are
  exempt (map keys and collections included) — only non-const usages
  can be magic.

## 0.8.3

### Fixed

- `magic_constants`: string literals used as index expressions
  (`map['key']`) are no longer flagged — protocol identifiers, not
  constants.

## 0.8.2

### Fixed

- Rebase artifact cleanup; republished after the 0.8.0 release series.

## 0.7.2

### Fixed

- `magic_constants`: string literals used as map keys are no longer
  flagged — they are protocol identifiers (JSON field names, channel
  names), not constants; extracting them added pure noise.

## 0.8.0

### Added

- `external` quality gate — wraps external static-analysis tools
  (detekt, ktlint, swiftlint, ...) emitting a Checkstyle XML report
  as rules `{id, executable, arguments}`; findings become standard
  violations with severity, baseline and diff mode support. This
  brings Kotlin/Swift code in Flutter monorepos into the same
  `crap4dart check` run (new `package:xml` dependency).

## 0.7.1

### Fixed

- `unused_files`: `export` directives now count as file usage — a package's
  public entry library reaches implementation files through exports, which
  the import-only graph missed, flagging every exported file as unused.
- `unused_code`: declaring a private method no longer removes its name from
  the reference set — cross-class private access within the same library
  (`host.controller._method()`) was reported as never referenced.

## 0.7.0

### Added

- `broken_goldens` quality gate — scans golden PNG files for rendered
  Flutter error artifacts: overflow stripes (yellow/black) and
  build-error screens (dark red). Golden tests do not fail on these;
  the pixels are the only witness (new `package:image` dependency).
- `test_assertions` quality gate — fails tests without assertion calls
  (`min_assertions`, default 1).
- `folder_structure` quality gate — flags directories with more than
  `max_loose_files` (default 0) loose `.dart` files instead of
  organized feature packages.

## 0.6.1

### Changed

- Dogfooding cleanup: every literal previously hidden in the committed
  baseline (304 violations — repeated YAML keys, CLI flag names, gate
  ids, JSON keys, path segments) is now a named constant. The baseline
  is empty; `check` passes with no grandfathered violations.

## 0.6.0

### Added

- `magic_constants` quality gate — flags magic literals: hex color
  values (`0xFFFF5733`) outside `const` declarations and numeric or
  string literals repeating `min_duplicates` (default 3) times in one
  file. Configurable via `gates.magic_constants` (`enabled`,
  `severity`, `ignorable`, `flag_hex_colors`, `min_duplicates`,
  `min_length`, `exclude`).

## 0.5.3

### Fixed

- `profile`: pub workspace members (`resolution: workspace`) can now be
  profiled. The temp copy gets a standalone `pubspec.yaml` (workspace marker
  stripped, relative `path:` dependencies absolutized) and runs
  `pub get` before the instrumented tests, instead of failing with
  "found no workspace root including it".

## 0.5.2

### Fixed

- `profile`: `part of` files are now skipped instead of being instrumented
  with an injected import — parts cannot contain directives, so the old
  behavior produced uncompilable code and the profiled test run failed.

## 0.5.1

### Fixed

- `unused_code` and `unused_files` now skip themselves in partial
  selection runs (`--changed`, `--staged`, `--diff`, explicit paths):
  their verdicts need the full source set, and partial runs previously
  produced false "never imported/referenced" positives.

## 0.5.0

### Added

- Gate framework: `severity: error | warning` per gate — warning gates
  report violations (`[WARN]`) without failing the run.
- Gate framework: `ignorable: true` opts a gate into `// crap:ignore`
  line comments and `// crap:ignore-file` file markers. Off by
  default — suppression is never allowed unless explicitly enabled.
- Gate framework: per-path threshold overrides (`entries`) for `loc`,
  `complexity` and `method_size` — relax or tighten thresholds per
  directory.
- Baseline mode: `check --save-baseline` records current violations to
  `.crap-baseline.json`; `check --baseline` fails only on violations
  not in the baseline.
- `nesting` gate — maximum block nesting level per method (default 5).
- `class_size` gate — methods-per-class (default 25) and
  weighted-methods-per-class (default 80) limits; catches god-classes.
- `weight_of_class` gate — flags classes revealing more data than
  behavior (default 0.33, disabled by default).
- `unused_code` gate — flags never-referenced private declarations.
- `unused_files` gate — flags never-imported files under `lib`.
- `banned_imports` gate — architectural import rules
  (`from`/`forbid`/`message`).

## 0.4.0

### Fixed

- `profile`: the collector import is now inserted after leading
  `library`/`part of`/`part` directives instead of blindly prepending it,
  which produced invalid Dart (compile error) on files starting with
  `library;`.

### Added

- `file_naming` quality gate — flags mechanical file names that indicate
  code was split to dodge the `loc` gate instead of along domain
  boundaries: numeric suffixes (`jira_batch1.dart`, `report2.dart`) and
  generic dumping-ground names (`utils.dart`, `helpers.dart`).
  Configurable via `gates.file_naming` (`enabled`, `exclude`, `allow`);
  technical stems such as `base64`/`sha256` are allowed by default.

## 0.3.0

### Added

- `profile` command — source-instrumentation-based per-method timing
  profiler. Creates a temporary instrumented copy of `lib/`, runs the test
  suite, and collects precise per-method timing (microseconds, not
  statistical sampling). Reports TOTAL(ms), %, CALLS, MEAN(µs), MAX(µs) and
  @60fps(ms) per method.
- `--name`, `--tags`, `--exclude-tags` flags for filtering which tests the
  profiler runs; positional `[paths...]` for explicit test file/directory
  targets.
- `@60fps(ms)` column in profile reports — estimates the per-frame cost of
  a method called every frame at 60 fps (`MEAN × 60`), highlighting methods
  that are cheap per-call but costly in a rebuild hot path.
- `profile` config section (`enabled`, `threshold_ms`, `top`).
- `skill` command — prints the crap4dart profiling skill content for AI
  agents, or shows installation instructions (`crap4dart skill`,
  `crap4dart skill --format install`).
- Profiling skill at `.agents/skills/crap4dart-profiling/SKILL.md` —
  teaches AI agents how to run and analyze profiling results.
- Full profiling reports saved to `profile-reports/` directory
  (`profile-report.txt` + `profile-report.json`), with automatic
  `.gitignore` entries for `profile-reports/` and `.crap_profile_temp/`.

### Changed

- `profile` now uses source instrumentation (wrapping every method body in a
  `Stopwatch` + `try/finally`) instead of VM service sampling. Timing is
  deterministic and exact rather than statistical.

### Removed

- `vm_service` as a direct dependency (it was needed for the previous
  VM-sampling approach; now only transitive).

## 0.2.1

### Changed

- `duplication` gate now tokenizes the whole Dart file (imports, declarations,
  classes, methods) instead of only method bodies, aligning its detection scope
  with jscpd while keeping the Dart-aware normalization and 1.0% default
  threshold.

## 0.2.0

### Added

- New `duplication` quality gate enabled by default. Detects exact copy-paste
  token blocks across Dart source files using `package:analyzer` tokenization
  and Rabin-Karp sliding-window indexing. A block counts when it is at least
  `min_tokens` (default 50) tokens and `min_lines` (default 5) lines long.
  The gate fails a file when its duplicated line percentage exceeds
  `threshold` (default 1.0%). Generated files and `test/**` are excluded by
  default.
- Cross-file duplicate detection: identical blocks in different files are
  reported in every file that contains them.

### Changed

- Quality gates now run in the order: `loc`, `test_coverage`, `complexity`,
  `method_size`, `duplication`, `public_docs`, `hardcoded_strings`,
  `accessibility`, `golden`.

## 0.1.3

- Same as 0.1.2, with the embedded `--version` string updated (it stayed
  hardcoded at 0.1.1 in the 0.1.2 archive).


## 0.1.2

- fix(cli): monorepo-aware staged/changed file resolution — git diff/status
  report paths relative to the repo top-level, but the runner joined them
  against the current directory, so `check --staged`/`analyze --changed`
  crashed with PathNotFoundException or scanned outside the package when
  run from a monorepo sub-package. Selections now resolve against
  `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (canonical, symlink-free) and are
  filtered to files inside the project root.


The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 0.1.1

- Fix the published package: `.gitignore` pattern `coverage/` also excluded
  `lib/src/coverage/` sources from both git and the pub.dev archive; anchor it
  to the repository root (`/coverage/`).
- CI workflow template and this repo's workflow install crap4dart from
  pub.dev instead of the git source; this repo's own CI self-hosts from the
  checkout.
- `Crap4DartRunner` and commands accept an optional `projectRoot`; the LCOV
  path resolves against it.
- CLI tests run in-process for honest coverage; `CoverageRunner` accepts an
  injectable process spawner; fix unawaited futures in file selection.
- `analyze --badge <path>` writes a local shields.io-style SVG badge with
  the max CRAP score (green/yellow/red against the threshold, grey for
  N/A); written even when the threshold is exceeded.

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

### Added

- CRAP analyzer for Dart/Flutter: cyclomatic complexity per method,
  LCOV coverage attribution, CRAP scores with a configurable threshold.
- Console report with CRAP, COV%, BR% (branch coverage), CC, method and
  location columns, sorted worst-first.
- 8 quality gates: `loc`, `test_coverage`, `golden`,
  `hardcoded_strings`, `accessibility`, `complexity`, `method_size`,
  `public_docs`.
- `crap4dart.yaml` configuration with per-key defaults merging and strict
  validation.
- `analyze`, `check`, `init` and `install` commands.
- Pre-commit hook installation with a managed marker block and `--force`
  merging into foreign hooks.
- GitHub Actions workflow template (`install --ci`) for Dart and Flutter
  projects.
- JSON output (`--format json`) for `analyze` and `check`.
- `--run-tests` coverage generation for `analyze` and `check`
  (`flutter test --coverage` / `dart test --coverage` + `format_coverage`).
- Configurable source directories via the top-level `sources` key, so
  gates (`loc`, `complexity`, `method_size`) can check test code too.
- `gates.test_coverage.dirs` to scope the coverage aggregate.
- Stricter LCOV attribution: entries outside the project root (e.g.
  pub-cache dependencies) are ignored when matching coverage to files.
- `count_lambdas` option (`crap` and `gates.complexity`) to exclude
  lambda branches from cyclomatic complexity.
- Global `exclude` glob patterns applied in every file selection mode.
- Diff mode (`--diff`, `--diff-base`): gates and CRAP analysis restricted
  to lines changed since a git base (ratchet for legacy codebases).
